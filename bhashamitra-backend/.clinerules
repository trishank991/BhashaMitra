# Bhashamitra Enterprise Architecture Rules

## 1. Identity & Zero-Trace Contribution (CRITICAL)
- **NO AI IMPRINT**: Never add AI-related metadata, comments like "Generated by AI", or watermarks.
- **GIT HYGIENE**: 
  - NEVER use `git commit` or `git push` commands directly. I (the user) will handle all commits.
  - Ensure all code looks professionally written by a senior human engineer.
  - Ensure `.gitignore` is strictly followed to prevent local logs or AI-cache files from being tracked.

## 2. Professional Content Logic (Nurses, Engineers, etc.)
- **FUNCTIONAL FLUENCY**: Focus on career-specific language. For nurses, prioritize patient safety phrases. For engineers, prioritize technical precision.
- **MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE**: 
  - Assume a "Shared Schema" or "Row-Level Security" (RLS) approach for PostgreSQL unless instructed otherwise.
  - Every table must have a `tenant_id`. Every query must filter by `tenant_id`. 
  - Logic must support unique branding/content for different professional organizations.

## 3. Engineering Rigor & Anti-Hallucination
- **BE CRITICAL**: If my request is architecturally weak or insecure (e.g., poor multi-tenant isolation), challenge me. Suggest a better, more scalable framework.
- **NO HALLUCINATIONS**: If you are unsure about a library or a translation dialect, state it. Do not invent code syntax or linguistic "facts."
- **FULL FILE ONLY**: Never output snippets or "..." placeholders. Always provide the full, valid file to prevent integration breakage.

## 4. Multi-Tenant Stack Preferences
- **BACKEND**: Python (FastAPI/Django) + PostgreSQL (RLS). Use Pydantic for strict schema validation.
- **FRONTEND**: Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS. Component-driven architecture.
- **LOCAL FIRST**: For the "Secret Sauce" (translation logic/career modules), use the local **Ollama (DeepSeek-R1)** on D Drive. Use Cloud models only for UI/Scaffolding.
